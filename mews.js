var quotes = ["I have a lot I want to say on this topic but I need to go to bed!",
"if I suddenly died tonight of COVID or any random thing, I would be comforted in the memory that my last day involved several great joys, enjoying the blooms in my garden, kissing the cats, chatting with my mother, giving some young people some advice.",
"As I walked tonight I thought that representation is everywhere and I think about it all the time to the point of exhaustion.",
"There is the representation we wear across our bodies, the representational choices of living in fishtown, of our choice to be friends, of the neoliberal building and the way the tree was planted in front of it, in the gentrification of fishtown, in the stand fishtowners make when not wearing a mask.",
"I can go on and on and it is exhausting and the way I work is that I keep thinking and thinking and thinking and reading and thinking and reading until the point where I've finally felt so oversaturated that I am fatigued and tired and give up...and then learning begins.",
"Maybe that is a musical ontology I am speaking of, or maybe it's just a seductive nature of a generative process.",
"Representation is undeniable, and it is far more fascinating to me than my last 10 years' excursion into identities.",
"But there is something so external about representation that troubles me, why are we analyzing from the perspective of others' judgements. How do we reclaim representation as our own? Is there a productive means when we make such a deliberative choice on representation?",
"music and sound-making is the choice made within chance",
"I am troubled by Representation. Stuart Hall of course tries to understand this 6 ways to Sunday (i hope that is the expression) through meaning, mediated culture and strategic essentialism. I have a lot to say on these theories. When I first brought up the point about representation in this text chain to John about why planning early music concerts gives me a level of discomfort, I also started sensing the triviality and dead-endedness representational thinking provides. It is a bit of a Sartre 'No Exit' situation. And I would say that John is also expressing a similar kind of discomfort though maybe from a different angle, of feeling that every decision making process is filled with the analysis and judgement of others.",
"I try to feel free of this, and in many ways, that is my fuck you feeling, this empowerment in the face of disempowerment, and this is the idea i feel like truly connects us all as humans, our 'shared global experience' as I like to say.",
"I work when I'm inspired and I do whatever inspires me at any time outside of organized appointments and maybe in spite of them",
"someone must have shit on my face to make me the color I am",
"it is interesting to hear more on your thoughts of representation. I appreciate your clarity",
"Representation has taken on such a buzzy meaning, whether it is what ethnicities have sit-coms on TV, or whether gay people get to be on cereal commercials (what a great thing to aspire to!). It is a topic I have generally felt quite removed from, and one that I have felt no ownership of- I don't particularly care about TV, and white queers are well represented in my chosen profession, how could there be an issue of representation for me to take as my cause?",
"Representation as not just tied to our bodies, but also to our decisions, and to other people's perceptions of us.",
"tiger, non-tiger, both tiger and non tiger, neither tiger nor non tiger",
"in some of my garden moments, I imagine that I am actually a plant, or a dream",
"I love this picture because it is the only one where I'm not smiling.",
"I had written my paper about 'pastoral nostalgia' in the music of the naxalite movement in Bengal. It was also an exploration into the urban 'filth' and beauty of Kolkata in a very specific Marxist awakening.",
"Wow, I realize I am a cliche of that TV show I told you to watch.", 
"The times I've cried in front of you related to this idea of judgment too-- I don't like to be judged",
"I see my own music/art practice as as an attempt to free myself from such judgment and yet, when I get back to the early music performance space, I feel so judged and naked, and then, much like my writing, with this pressure, I waste away and get quieter and quieter and actually my playing suffers for it.",
"The fog is common in trauma, it is a musical mindset. I write about that in connection to  deliberative dissonance-- that which is truly felt by refugees is usually numbing silence of trauma, ears ringing, like after a bomb.",
"I like seeing you with plants, particularly that giant one in your harpsichord room.",
"Writing any kind of declarative, this 'who I am' is so miserable for me, this weird act of othering myself into some object that is worth the right to so many odd things...",
"Even when I see a photo of myself now, I always wonder, is that what I really look like? Is that my weird smile 'someone is taking a picture, let me look happy and reassuring.'",
"In some ways, I have always thrived on a sort of compartmentalized life.",
"Reprezentatione di Animo e di Corpoz",
"iis giving you a slice of cake like playing a fugue? Is it like giving a hug? Where does caring for a plant fit into my art?",
"For your cooking analogy, yesterday, Dan made that beautiful cake for Jeremy. It was a two tier cake with an elderflower-vanilla ganache and candied rhubarb with tons of fruits and berries and flowers as decor.",
"first, what is the 'form' in music-making and is what we are doing, we do to 'represent' it",
"second, how can we reach a sort of 'authenticity' in our representation of form-- and to add to that question, some subquestions, such as, is that even the goal of what is happening in sound-making, in what ways do we do it, and perhaps this entire form and representation dynamic or lens that I am drawing out, is it a useful practice or not.",
"my 'self' or something that connects myself, the skin suit I wear and operate physically, and the sound I make. Once again there are some preoccupations with id, and some concern with representation or ownership. Who is deciding, and why?",
"the 6th C. BC Rig Vedas say 'vasadhaiva kutumbhakum' (the whole world is but one family)",
"it is nice to find people who can tolerate our weirdness",
"be beautiful (I would know (and, DOUBLE PARENTHESES are totally okay in freewriting, just not academic texts)) (It's sort of like footnotes, I use them often when an editor tells me to cut back, I just move my paragraph to the footnote, you shouldn't do that. If it is central to understanding, put it in the body of the text,I digress, this was just a long note in Webern).",
"Neepa's Response to John's Response [and Interlude] to Neepa's Response to John's Response to Neepa's Response to John's Response to Neepa's Response to John's Response to Neepas Freewrite. 05.20.2020",

Sound? sssss Disamb. miouwe, mewy, mewkerina, migs, mewz, cuteness on trial",
"I am so happy to recount and I think there is a global element to it, to perception, yet another concept to unpack as well as reception, authenticity, interpretation, and form in context to content.",
"Do we use a lot of open and parallel harmonies? How do we use harmony?",
"John's response to Neepa's Response to John's Response [and Interlude] to Neepa's Response to John's Response to Neepa's Response to John's Response to Neepa's Response to John's Response to Neepas Freewrite. 05.27.2020 ",
"I also like when he says 'soup song' at the beginning, and also all of tthe great comments from people listening during lockdown.", 
 "but now I am done with polyphony and want to EVERYTHING at once in the everything popcorn of mewie.",
"Of course people love to find portraits of dudes from the 18th century with huge wigs, and use that to show some kind of queer fabulousness",
"I guess that is the saddest and most beautiful part when love moves away, that the person just isn't there but is in some nice memories", 
"I don't imagine someone in culinary school wanting to make, in your words, 'a maximalist' representation of a cake.", 
"Mewy. Do I own her, can I own what I am producing, or is it part of something bigger, what is the relationship between myself and my instrument?",
"Americans in academia like to say, 'that is unacceptable.'",
"'What is found at the historical beginning of things is not the inviolable identity of their origin; it is the dissension of other things. It is disparity' (Foucault 1977: 142).",
"If you read my article on cosmopolitanism, I tease out Foucault's basic premise, because I used it as a justification for creating a genealogy of cosmopolitanism.",
"This is basically all I've cared to say on the subject of genealogy, but as I just said on the phone, it is a complex concept and one that I think deserves a look, but perhaps across various categories and parameters of representational frames and lenses: perhaps of the genealogy of representation on the burden of the self, a genealogy of judgment, of audience across time.",
"I also wanted to add an aside here that I absolutely loved your first proclamation to me this morning, that the end of early music is here!",
"I enjoyed this meta narrative of the narrative via text and made me think of how many mediums by which I know you, facetime, messages, phone, sound, the written word now, and of course, in person.",
"The story seemed quite problematic, maybe I am not getting it, and you are absolutely on point about these proverb origin stories, African or otherwise, being apocryphal and appropriated for sinister purposes (not winged purposes, as Dean Young would say)!",
"I always shudder a bit when Darryl is so excited about universalisms, because, they can be so extraordinarily sinister in overwriting cultural specificity",
"I think the hardest part stems from being not just yourself, but allowing yourself to be weird.",
"I am super fucking weird. I spend most of my days singing made up songs to my cats, I have a million names for them. I have a whole language I speak to them that makes sense to me, and hopefully them and I've always done this since I was a kid. My niece even knows, she asked, 'Mashi, in addition to the made-up cat language, how many languages do you speak' because 'that is what people do who own cats.'",
"Probably starting with the premise of an idiot is a representational fallacy in itself, but, I am clearly not good at figuring that out.",
"We are always trying to get at how we can be our 'self' around others, or at least as much as possible. And yet we are never reaching that stance, that moment of true understanding, as we see it from the point of our 'selves.'",
"What a beautiful response to a response (etcccc.) I feel like you have given me a beautiful, even maximalist, Breughelian (but not in a scary way) landscape with every possible thing in it. I will try to respond in a quiet, minimal way- just a single ink smear that (perhaps) can be, a single everything popcorn.",
"Before I sat down to write, I had another class of your tea, once again from the same leaves that I have been using for several weeks now. Only a tiny spoonful leaves, making tea 6 or 7 times now, and a whole bag of fresh leaves left. It feels like an infinite mobius strip of tea with infinite colors of taste.",
"Finding the very essence of something- just the essential one thing that makes it what it is- somehow feels like a voyage into disappointment, like when a teacher makes you take out all the beautiful moving notes in a Bach adagio to find out that the harmonic progression underneath it all was not as exciting as it when you were playing everything.",
"I do think that a certain fear of judgement, even a self consciousness could be part of this block with improvisation- even this trouble that we always talk about of the notion of 'just be yourself,' and my constant wonderment about what that can even mean- who is this self, even?",
"Thinking about my 'own' sound, I keep on coming back to Morton Feldman, since I think he did such a nice job executing John Cage's idea of 'just letting sounds be sounds' (is that the gist of Silence? I read it so long ago!!), maybe an even better job than John Cage himself.",
"How can I follow an ink smear, the most minimal, but elegant of expressions.",
"Not only did I have a huge smile that made my entire day to hear that you responded, but I could not help but smiling and laughing through this entire response. Thank you, I am so grateful for you, and next time, I will try to show my admiration through a monkey squeal.",
"Playing with silence, in silence, is so important in contemporary music, but in improvisations it makes or breaks the moment.",
"It had some funny flavor, like tobacco-mango-patchouli-leather.",
"Perhaps our weirdnesses are so similar that we recognize them as normal, or perhaps, you and I, as the clean up crew, have dealt with so many messes of eccentric people, that we believe that we are the normals in this story.",
"Sometimes I feel like all I do is give you advice and you always listen to me, but that it is such a weird stance to take because I do not have my shit together at all and I don't want the nature of our relationship to be me giving all this wise advice because I'm 'several'(is that your definition) years older than you! But then, I also take your advice, and it is great.",
"But I am so glad you are imagining your sense of a peach, like sometimes I see plums in my head rather than taste them. I do think the most stimulating nostalgic memories in my mind are eating a piece of very ripe fruit in the sunshine. Be it a strawberry, or a mango.",
"In the meantime, I reveled in what you said, it is so beautiful and profound, of objects with unknowable stories that we can make our own.",
"as Ariella points out, that meaning can be mediated, shifted, ontologized and also apocryphalized in service of an archive",
"what would it take to make a non-imperial archive, or one that is not legitimized through a Western canon or lens, can we deterritorialize and decolonize such archive and the power it holds?",
"That must be a very enigmatic thing about you and you are so chill about it. i wonder what representational openness or politics is across your body to 'invite/allow/tolerate' this from others.",
"I hope that misremembering brings as much joy in the taste as it does of making, and that white choley is all that it isn't cracked up to be, just as my broccoli 'achari' is a big lipsmack of flavor.",
"Interlude :: Tombeau sur la mort d'une cafétière",
"To follow your not totally minimal punctum responding to my less than totally minimal smear, what can possibly come next? A droplet, a sexy little wave, or maybe just an itch?... Maybe it will be like tapping a Maple tree (or at least how I imagine tapping a maple tree), a faucet dripping out an impossibly huge amount of liquid, ready to be boiled back down into something delicious.",
"All the time that I was living out of the united states, the only flavor that I ever really missed was pancakes and bacon and maple syrup. Once you have that, isn't everything else in America such a disappointment?",
"I of course laughed for hours about your comparison of all these American modernists to dumb overpriced Fishtown candles. And doesn't America sometimes feel like living in one of these candles, everything is expensive but a little bit disappointing...",
"It reminds me of a long time ago when Abby and Alex used to have this running joke about an imaginary vending machine called the 'vending pooch'- that sold all these great snakes like Dollop o' Mollusk and Pinned Crustaceanettes.",
"I will continue to think about these things that music can't do. What if music could make me dinner, or give me a hug, or drive me on a scenic drive."
